# rockPaperScissors
A simple Javascirpt rock, paper, scissors game.


Practice using if/else in JS for the most part. Also operating with multiple functions, function scope was important for this project. 

Ended up making a variation that allows the user to click on the individual images to pick an option. 

If i were to remake this I'd plan it out from the start so as to have more structure in my html. Perhaps add visible point counters.
